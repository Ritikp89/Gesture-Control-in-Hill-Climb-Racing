Overview
This repository contains a project that enables gesture control for the popular game Hill Climb Racing. By utilizing machine learning techniques and hand gesture recognition, players can control their vehicle using hand movements without the need for traditional input devices. This innovative approach enhances the gaming experience by providing a unique and interactive way to play.
Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to create an engaging and immersive way to interact with Hill Climb Racing. Traditional controls can be limiting and less intuitive. By implementing gesture control, we aim to make gaming more accessible and enjoyable, particularly for users who may prefer touchless interaction.
Features
Gesture Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe to track hand movements and recognize gestures.
Touchless Control: Players can control their vehicle solely through hand gestures, eliminating the need for keyboard or mouse input.
Real-time Processing: Efficiently processes hand movements in real-time for a seamless gaming experience.
Technologies Used
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks, including image processing and gesture recognition.
Mediapipe: A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, used here for hand tracking.
Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the project
Installation
To get started with the gesture control system, follow these steps:
1.Clone the Repository
2.Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries
3.Launch Hill Climb Racing
Open Hill Climb Racing on your device. The application will begin recognizing your gestures as inputs for the game.
